### **Hi there! 😁**

My name is Paula Pompeo from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working **with technology** since 2019 and currently I'm  Front-End Developer at [Macai]([https://macaiapp.com/](https://macaiapp.com/)). I'm passionate about learning new techs. I appreciate working as a team, due to the opportunity to gain different perspectives. I have experience in Web development for modern rich internet applications with the latest technologies like ReactJs, NodeJs, MongoDB, GraphQL, Javascript, Typescript, HTML5, CSS3, GitHub and AWS.


My personal interests revolve around music, animal and human rights.

Would you like to find me?
